<h2><b>Your code, your control</b></h2>

<p class="paragraphNormal">

Security is top of mind at Bito, especially when it comes to your code. A fundamental approach we have taken is we do not store any code, code snippets, indexes or embedding vectors on Bito’s servers unless you expressly allow it.  You decide where you want to store your code, either locally on your machine, in your cloud, or on Bito’s cloud.  Importantly, our AI partners do not store any of this information.
<br><br>
All requests are transmitted over HTTPS and are fully encrypted.
<br><br>
None of your code or AI requests are used for AI model training. None of your code or AI requests are stored by our AI partners. Our AI model partners are OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
